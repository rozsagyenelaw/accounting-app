## Usage

### 1. Enter Case Information

Fill out the case details form with:
- Trust/Conservatorship name
- Case number
- Court information
- Petitioner and trustor/conservatee details
- Accounting period dates
- Bond amount

### 2. Add Asset Information

Enter details about:
- Bank accounts (name, account number, balances)
- Real property (address, appraised value)
- Other non-cash assets

### 3. Upload Bank Statements

Upload bank statements in PDF or CSV format. The system will:
- Extract all transactions
- Parse dates, descriptions, and amounts
- Distinguish receipts from disbursements
- Auto-classify each transaction

### 4. Review Transactions

Review the automatically classified transactions:
- View confidence scores
- Manually adjust categories if needed
- Add check numbers where applicable
- Flag items for further review

### 5. Generate Forms

**Option 1: Fill Actual PDF Forms (Recommended)**

1. Upload a fillable GC-400 PDF template to `public/forms/templates/GC-400.pdf`
2. Click "Generate GC-400 Forms (PDF)" on the Summary Dashboard
3. The system will automatically fill the template with your data
4. Download the filled PDF ready for court filing

**Option 2: Generate from Scratch**

If no template is uploaded, the system generates:
- Cover Petition (pages 1-4)
- GC-400(SUM) - Summary of Account
- GC-400(PH) - Property on Hand at Beginning
- Schedule A - Receipts (by category)
- Schedule C - Disbursements (by category)
- Schedule E - Property on Hand at End

📖 **See [PDF_FORM_FILLING_GUIDE.md](./PDF_FORM_FILLING_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on using fillable PDF forms**

## Transaction Categories

### Receipts (Schedule A)

- **A(2) - Interest**: Bank interest, investment interest
- **A(3) - Pensions, Annuities**: Trust distributions, pension payments
- **A(5) - Social Security, VA Benefits**: SSA, SSI, SSDI, VA payments
- **A(6) - Other Receipts**: Refunds, reimbursements, miscellaneous

### Disbursements (Schedule C)

- **C(1) - Caregiver Expenses**: In-home care, nursing
- **C(2) - Residential Facility Expenses**: Utilities, maintenance, security
- **C(4) - Fiduciary and Attorney Fees**: Legal fees, trustee compensation
- **C(5) - General Administration**: Court fees, bond premiums
- **C(6) - Medical Expenses**: Doctors, hospitals, prescriptions
- **C(7) - Living Expenses**: Food, clothing, entertainment, etc.
- **C(8) - Taxes**: Income tax, property tax
- **C(9) - Other Disbursements**: Charitable donations, miscellaneous

## Classification Engine

The transaction classifier uses keyword-based matching with confidence scoring:

1. **Keyword Matching**: Compares transaction descriptions against category-specific keywords
2. **Weighted Scoring**: Different keywords have different weights based on specificity
3. **Confidence Score**: 0-100 scale indicating classification certainty
4. **Sub-Category Support**: Automatically assigns sub-categories for C(2) and C(7)

Low confidence transactions (< 70%) are flagged for manual review.

## Bank Statement Formats

### Supported CSV Formats

The parser automatically detects column headers for:
- Date fields: "Date", "Posted Date", "Transaction Date"
- Description: "Description", "Memo", "Detail", "Payee"
- Amount: "Amount", "Debit", "Credit", "Withdrawal", "Deposit"

### Supported PDF Formats

Basic PDF parsing is supported but CSV is recommended for best results. The parser looks for transaction patterns like:

```
01/15/2024 AMAZON.COM $45.67
```

## Form Generation

Forms are generated in compliance with California Judicial Council standards:
- Proper page numbering
- Correct form headers and footers
- Category subtotals
- Mathematical reconciliation
- Court-compliant formatting

## Data Persistence

Session data is stored in browser localStorage, allowing users to:
- Save work in progress
- Return to incomplete accountings
- Export transaction data

## Deployment to Netlify

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
3. Deploy

Or use the Netlify CLI:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Legal Disclaimer**: This application assists with petition preparation but should not replace legal counsel. Always verify generated forms with an attorney familiar with California probate law.

⚠️ **Court Requirements**: Some courts have specific local rules beyond standard GC-400 forms. Verify local requirements before filing.

⚠️ **Data Security**: Sensitive client data is stored only in browser localStorage. Do not share or export data to untrusted systems.
